## Reason of selection:
As a mobile developer, I don't usually interect with backend so I have choosen a task which was less focused on Backend and more on Frontend. 

## Test Environment
Xcode Simulator.

## Design Pattern
MVP

## Backend
I have used Firebase storage for this project.
For test purposes, there are no read/write rules for authentication. Anyone can read and write the data.
